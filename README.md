### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Will Richards and I am a CS Major at Oregon State University
I am currently the Lead Firmware Engineer at the [Openly Published Environmental Sensing Lab (OPEnS)](https://open-sensing.org/)
And also a Firmware Engineer at the [Soundbendor Labs](https://soundbendor.org/)

# Compute Knowledge
 - I have extensive experience working with FRC style control systems as well as other robotic systems such as ROS
 - As well as the general programming languages: C#, Python, Java, Arduino-C, Shell, Dart, C++
 - I also have experience with OpenCV based vision processing

# Learning
 - Also learning Rust (Rust and C++ syntax and structure are very similar which makes this easier)
