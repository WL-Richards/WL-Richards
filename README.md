### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Will Richards and I am a CS Major at Oregon State University <br>
I am currently the Lead Firmware Engineer at the [Openly Published Environmental Sensing Lab (OPEnS)](https://open-sensing.org/) <br>
And also a Firmware Engineer at the [Soundbendor Labs](https://soundbendor.org/)

# Compute Knowledge
