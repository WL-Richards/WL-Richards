### Hi there 👋
My name is Will Richards and I am a CS Major at Oregon State University <br>
I am currently the Lead Firmware Engineer at the [Openly Published Environmental Sensing Lab (OPEnS)](https://open-sensing.org/) and a Firmware Engineer at the [Soundbendor Labs](https://soundbendor.org/)

# Compute Knowledge
 - I have ~3 years of in-depth microcontroller firmware development.
 - As well as the general programming languages: C++, C, C#, Python, Java, Arduino-C, Shell, Dart, ROS

# Learning
 - Also learning Rust (Rust and C++ syntax and structure are very similar which makes this easier)
